# ICP

This repository contains implementations of the iterative closest point
algorithm. The `matlab` subdirectory has all implementations of HMRF ICP, as
discussed in "Robust low-overlap 3-D point cloud registration for outlier
rejection" (ICRA 2019), for which no compilation is needed.

A demonstration of the method can be run easily from the `demo` subdirectory.
